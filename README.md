## Overview
Determine if citibike originally used in New York City can be translated to Des Moines. A story developed in Tableau is done to convince investors tha the back sharing program in Des Moines will be successful. For this analysis "tripduartion" datatype was changed from integer to datetime in Jupyter Notebook. Additionally, various visualizations were created to popular times throughout the day, weekdays, and difference between genders. 

## Results

A total of seven visualizations were used, two were pulled from module work. I implemented the top starting and ending locations to show areas of highest demand within the city. Hot spots for starting and ending locations were the same. Additionally, graphs identifying checkout times for users with the additional view of genders also took place. The primary 10 minutes within the first hour is the most popular, with men comprosing of the highest utilization. Furthermore, two additional charts were created to view high demand hours within the day. This chart was then duplicated to view the differences between the genders. 6am-9am and 5pm-7mp experienced the highest amount of traffic, with men again leading in popularity. Lastly, a graph visualizing the popularity by weekday, gender, and usertype was also created. Subscriber males were the most popular with Thursday being the highest day of utilization. 

## Summary

Overall, it is clear to see that there is substantial demand for citibike to blossum in Des Moines. Two additional visualizations that would be beneficial include viewing the most active start and end stations. This then can be viewed by rush time hours as well to see the flow of traffic. Furthermoe a visualization viewing the average trip during by birth year and gender to understand if there are any significant differences in the users.
